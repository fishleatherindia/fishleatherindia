  <meta name="description" content="Fish leather is as you might expect, but may well still be surprised by, the cured and tanned skins of fish. The diversity of fish leather available is enormous due to the use of different fish species and the variety of the finishes that can be applied.

The texture of the leather is dependent on the size and shape of the scale pockets which can vary from 2mm to 2cm in size according to the species.Fish leather is an eco-friendly alternative to the typical exotic leathers such as crocodile and snake that threaten endangered species. Fish leather has a unique look, yet you’ll find that the strength and smell of the material is comparable to commonly used land-based leathers. Fish leather can be used for many purposes, including crafts and more professional use.

The production of fish leather is a long and complicated process that takes between 30 to 45 days from start to finish with several distinct stages. Each species has slightly different requirements due to the presence of varying levels of oils and whether it is a freshwater or saltwater fish but generally the fish skins require churning, soaking in chemical solutions that remove the scales and natural oils, and then tanning before being thoroughly dried. The exact details of the process are a closely guarded secret as only a handful of manufacturers in the world are able to make it to a high standard after years of experimentation and fine tuning.

Before fish leather became popular the skin of fishes processed by fisheries was considered a mere by-product of the edible fish industry and as a result was often dumped back into the sea with a potential to pollute surrounding waters. This is why fish leather is considered an environmentally friendly, eco material as less of the fish is wasted and it can start to replace bovine leather usage. None of our fish leather is derived from endangered specie.

It might seem surprising that the soft, flakey substance we’re used to seeing on the fish we eat can be made to be so strong but then again it’s worth bearing in mind that shark leather is 5 times stronger than that of cow.

Fish leather really is a remarkably strong material although there’s some differences between species. While salmon and tilapia are somewhat more flexible and can stretch to a degree, carp and sea bass is far thicker and more rigid. Fish leather in general is often likened to being as strong as sheep skin and certainly strong enough for virtually any application.

Fish leather can be used to make a wide variety of items such as jewellery, accessories including phone or iPad cases, belts, wallets and bags as well as artwork and even for binding books. Fish leather is suitable for home crafts as well as professional use. All of the fish leather finished products that can be found in our shop have been hand-made by us and they show a good example of what can be done with this remarkable material.

Due to the naturally occuring size variations present in the fish leathers we sell, we think it’s fairer to offer you the option between small, medium, large and extra large fish leathers where possible. The breakdown on how we decide on the size of individual leathers by species is as follows.

Carp

The carp skin leather is available in the sizes small, medium and large. They vary in length as well as width. The sizes within the size category will show minor differences in size, but sometimes the tail will be smaller or the middle wider.

Carp Fish Leather Size

Small
Length: between 35cm (13 3/4″) and 45cm (17 3/4″).
Width: between 6cm (2 3/8″) and 10cm (4″).
Most usable area will have an average width of about 7 to 8cm, but the tail end can sometimes be only 3.5cm.

Medium
Length: between 40cm (15 3/4″) and 55cm (21 5/8″).
Width: between 7cm (2 3/4″) and 10cm (4″).
It will be less likely that there is a small tail end and it often has a wider usable area (average width of 8 to 9cm).

Large
Length: between 50cm (19 3/4″) and 60cm (23 5/8″).
Width: between 10cm (4″) to 15cm (5 7/8″).
Most of this size of carp will have a width of at least 10cm giving a large useable area. Some of the leather in this category will even have a width of 20cm at its widest part.

Perch

Perch has generally a larger usable area than most other fish species thanks to it’s width, which can be up to 20cm! Also is it less likely that the ends are small. Perch is available in medium and large.

Perch Fish Leather Size

Medium
Width: between 12cm (4 3/4″) and 16cm (6 1/4″).
Length: between 32cm (1ft 1/2″) and 50cm (19 5/8″).

Large
Width: between 17cm (6 3/4″) and 20cm (7 7/8″).
Length: between 36cm (14 1/8″) and 65cm 25 2/4″).">
